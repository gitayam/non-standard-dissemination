 TP 350-70-14

## Problem Statement

Write a problem statement to specify the performance gap.  For example: "The problem is… Military Intelligence Soldiers are not completing status reports to include all elements specified by the standard."

## Needs Analysis

### Perform a DOTMLPF Analysis on your problem statement:  
   • Determine whether or not each DOTMLPF domain applies to your problem statement.  For each applicable domain:  
            − Identify the current state of the domain as it pertains to your problem statement and  
            − Propose actions that may alleviate the problem  
   • Answer the three questions on the DOTMLPF tab below the DOTMLPF analysis to prepare for goal analysis.

## Goal/Topic Analysis-(as required)

Complete Goal Analysis based on the problem statement and needs analysis to write your SCOPE and OUTCOME statements.  
Complete a Topic Analysis to identify topical areas (i.e., Major/Minor Topics) to be covered by training arranged in a hierarchy. 

## Task Analysis/ TTI

Create a total task inventory (TTI) (5 tasks). Ensure task titles are written according to business rules, using action verbs aligned with the learning domain and level per TP 350-70-1 Appendix E.

## Difficulty Importance Frequency (DIF):

Perform a Difficulty-Importance-Frequency (DIF) Model analysis on the tasks listed in the TTI to identify potential critical tasks. Update total task inventory (TTI) with potential critical tasks to present to CTSSB (5 tasks).

## Individual Task Analysis: 

Select the two tasks with the highest training priority from the DIF Model analysis and conduct an "Individual Task Analysis" on each, ensuring to include:  
   • Task Title (from TTI)  
   • Task Condition Statement  
   • Task Standard Statement  
   • Performance Steps (You must have a minimum of three performance steps but you need not 'complete' the task in three steps)   • For Each Performance Step:  
            − References  
            − Supporting and Supported Individual Tasks (if applicable)  
            − Environmental and Safety             
            − Knowledge  
            − Skills  
            − Resources, Materiels  
            − Step Notes / Cues (if applicable)

## Skills and Knowledge (S&K) Matrix:

For each of the two tasks you analyzed in the previous step, complete a Skill and Knowledge Matrix and answer the two questions below the S&K Matrix tables.

Performance Measures:

Complete the Performance Measures for the two tasks you completed in the Individual Task Analysis.   
Complete the three steps and any sub-steps needed.  Answer the questions using the drop-down boxes.   
Select whether the step has sub-steps [Yes or No].  
Select whether the performance measures are a "Product", "Process", or "Combination".  
Indicate where the performance measures are based on type of performance standard used by selecting either "Go", "No Go", or "N/A".

## Target Audience Analysis:

Create a Target Audience Profile (TAP) Analysis for the trainees who will engage in the training. This should include all critical characteristics needed to perform each critical task, including any prerequisite skills.

## Gap and Resource Analysis:

Perform a Gap and resource Analysis to update the scope statement and identify resources required to deliver training.  
Additional instructions are provided on the sheet.

## Milestone Plan:

The milestone plan identifies key review points (e.g., gate reviews) and deliverables within each phase of the ADDIE process, forming the basis of a project management plan.  Milestones also comprise Synchronization Meetings, which are proponent meetings with all affected stakeholders to identify, align, and prioritize critical learning requirements supporting Army readiness. Examples of synchronization meetings include the critical task and site selection board (CTSSB), post-instructional conference (PIC), and course design review (CDR).  All synchronization meetings will involve faculty and staff development and delivery activities that support the Army mission and Army learning intent for the purpose of refinement and prioritization of learning requirements. (TP 350-70-14 (2018), Appendix C)  
It is IMPORTANT TO NOTE that the milestone plan is updated minimally at the end of each phase in the ADDIE process.

## TLO-ELO-LSAs:

Write a TLO for your course; you can base the TLO on your task or an objective your task will support.  For the TLO, include:  
   • Action Statement  
   • Condition Statement  
   • Standard Statement  
   • Two subordinate ELOs that each have:  
            − An Action Statement  
            − A Condition Statement  
            − A Standard Statement  
   • Two subordinate LSAs for each ELO or four LSAs with no ELOs that each have:  
            − An Action Statement *** or TLO and four (4) LSAs

## Lesson Plan Matrix:

Complete the Lesson Plan (LP) Matrix for your TLO and ELOs.  You will develop ELO-A and ELO-B with only two LSAs each.  For each LSA, indicate the:  
   • Content Type (Procedure; Concept; Fact; Process; or Principle)  
   • Cognitive Level (Blooms Taxonomy of the Cognitive Domain)  
   • Method of Instruction (MOI)  
   • Time of Instruction (give an estimate for the number of hours/minutes instructing the LSA will require)  
   • ALA/GLOs (Described in the GLO White Paper)

## Lesson Plan Outline:

The "Lesson Plan Outline" tab provides general guidance on completing the CAC-approved TDC formatted "Lesson Plan."

Lesson Plan:

This is the outline you will use for filling out the lesson plan.  The directions are on the previous tab.

## Implementation Plan:

Describe your implementation plan for your lesson.

## Post-Mortem:

Identify Significant Potential Failures and Solutions.

## Formative Evaluation:

Describe the formative evaluations you did as you went through the ADDIE process for your lesson.

## Summative Evaluation:

Describe the summative evaluation tools you will use for your lesson.
