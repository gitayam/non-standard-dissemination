# Problem Statement, Description, and Scope for Modern Aerial Dissemination
## Mission: Support Operations in the Information Environment (OIE) through modern aerial dissemination techniques
## Collective Task: Calculate and apply UAS leaflet dissemination parameters to develop effective information delivery plans

## Problem Statement
### Problem:  
Information forces trained in traditional aerial leaflet dissemination lack standardized calculation methods for employing small unmanned aircraft systems (SUAS) as a modern delivery platform, limiting operational effectiveness in contemporary environments like those observed in Ukraine.

## Problem Description
### Description:  
The proliferation of SUAS in modern conflicts, particularly in Ukraine, has transformed aerial dissemination capabilities for OIE. While SUAS platforms have proven highly effective for message dissemination, current training for information forces does not adequately address the specialized calculation methods required for precise SUAS leaflet delivery. 

Both newly qualified personnel and experienced operators familiar with traditional aerial leaflet delivery require updated training on drift calculations, dispersion patterns, and flight planning specific to SUAS platforms. The basic principles remain similar to traditional methods, but proper adaptation requires standardization and professional application of these calculations to ensure message delivery accuracy and operational success across all information forces.

## Scope Statement
### Scope of the Performance Problem:  
This performance gap affects all OIE personnel involved in aerial dissemination operations, from PSYOP specialists to civil affairs teams and other information forces. Without standardized calculation methods for SUAS leaflet operations, units risk ineffective message delivery, wasted resources, and diminished information impact. The growing reliance on SUAS platforms across operational theaters makes addressing this knowledge gap increasingly urgent for all information forces.

### Impact Areas:
1. Increased Vulnerability:  
   Without proper calculation methods, SUAS leaflet operations may miss intended target audiences, requiring repeated missions that increase platform exposure to enemy detection and countermeasures, affecting the security of all information force elements.

2. Public Support:  
   Unprofessional or inaccurate leaflet delivery may result in unintended audiences receiving information materials, potentially undermining broader information strategies and damaging public perception of friendly forces' competence and professionalism.

3. Stability and Governance:  
   Ineffective information delivery diminishes the ability to influence target populations in support of stability operations and governance initiatives, particularly in contested environments where physical access is limited and information forces are critical enablers.

4. Operational Integrity:  
   Ad hoc or improvised calculation methods create inconsistent results across information forces, undermining standardization, lesson-sharing, and the professional reputation of OIE as a precision capability in the overall operational framework.
