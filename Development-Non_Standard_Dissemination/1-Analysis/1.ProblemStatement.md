# Problem Statement, Description, and Scope 
## Mission: Support tactical PSYOP operations through modern aerial dissemination techniques with partner forces
## Collective Task: Calculate and apply UAS leaflet dissemination parameters to develop effective MISO delivery plans in multinational environments

## Problem Statement
### Problem:  
Tactical PSYOP forces trained in traditional aerial leaflet dissemination lack standardized calculation methods for employing small unmanned aircraft systems (SUAS) as a modern delivery platform, limiting operational effectiveness and interoperability with partner forces in contemporary environments like those observed in Ukraine.

## Problem Description
### Description:  
The proliferation of SUAS in modern conflicts, particularly in Ukraine, has transformed aerial dissemination capabilities for tactical PSYOP operations. While SUAS platforms have proven highly effective for message dissemination, current training for tactical PSYOP forces does not adequately address the specialized calculation methods required for precise SUAS leaflet delivery or for effective interoperability with partner forces' SUAS capabilities. 

Both newly qualified PSYOP personnel and experienced operators familiar with traditional aerial leaflet delivery require updated training on drift calculations, dispersion patterns, and flight planning specific to SUAS platforms. The basic principles remain similar to traditional methods, but proper adaptation requires standardization and professional application of these calculations to ensure message delivery accuracy and operational success. This is especially critical for tactical PSYOP teams working alongside partner forces who may already utilize SUAS capabilities but employ different calculation methodologies.

## Scope Statement
### Scope of the Performance Problem:  
This performance gap primarily affects tactical PSYOP forces involved in aerial dissemination operations, especially those working directly with partner nation forces. Without standardized calculation methods for SUAS leaflet operations that can be shared with multinational partners, PSYOP teams risk ineffective message delivery, wasted resources, diminished psychological impact, and reduced interoperability. The growing adoption of SUAS platforms at the tactical level by both U.S. and partner forces makes addressing this knowledge gap increasingly urgent.

### Impact Areas:
1. Operational Security:  
   Without proper calculation methods, SUAS leaflet operations may miss intended target audiences, requiring repeated missions that increase platform exposure to enemy detection and countermeasures. This creates security risks for both U.S. PSYOP teams and partner forces operating in contested environments.

2. Interoperability:  
   Differing calculation methodologies between U.S. PSYOP teams and partner forces create friction during combined operations, reducing efficiency and effectiveness. Standardized calculation methods enable seamless cooperation, shared mission planning, and mutual equipment utilization between U.S. and partner forces conducting aerial dissemination.

3. Coalition Effectiveness:  
   Ineffective PSYOP message delivery diminishes the ability to influence local target populations in support of coalition tactical objectives, stability operations, and governance initiatives. Synchronized calculation methods ensure consistent message delivery regardless of which coalition partner is executing the mission.

4. Professional Integration:  
   Ad hoc or improvised calculation methods create inconsistent results across multinational PSYOP teams, undermining standardization, lesson-sharing, and professional credibility. A unified approach to SUAS calculations enhances the reputation of all coalition PSYOP forces as integrated, precision influence operators capable of coordinated execution.
