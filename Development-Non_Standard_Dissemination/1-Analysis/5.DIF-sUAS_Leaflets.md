## Analysis Notes and Justification:

1. **Task Difficulty**: 
   - Calculation tasks (8-15) were rated as "Very Difficult" because most PSYOP soldiers lack experience with these specialized mathematical calculations as noted in the problem statement
   - Planning and operational tasks (1-7, 16-17, 19-20) were rated as "Moderately Difficult" due to the need for technical knowledge but with support from existing systems
   - Documentation (18) was rated as "Not Difficult" as it follows standard procedures

2. **Task Importance**: 
   - All tasks were rated as "Important" (Y) because they directly support successful mission execution and achieve MISO objectives
   - Improper execution of any task could lead to mission failure or reduced effectiveness

3. **Task Frequency**:
   - Planning tasks (2-7) were rated as "Very Frequent" because they would be conducted for each mission
   - Calculation and specialized tasks (1, 8-17, 19-20) were rated as "Moderately Frequent" as they would be required for all sUAS operations, which occur more frequently than traditional aerial dissemination due to lower resource requirements
   - No tasks were rated as "Infrequent" because the problem statement indicates sUAS operations are becoming increasingly common

4. **Training Priority Recommendations**:
   - "Overtrain" (OT) recommendation for all calculation tasks and specialized skills to ensure proficiency despite their difficulty
   - "Train" (T) recommendation for common planning tasks that will be frequently performed
