# TASK 1: Plan Aerial Dissemination with sUAS

### Action:
Design a comprehensive flight plan for sUAS-based leaflet dissemination that calculates release parameters, drift and dispersion patterns, and integrates realâ€‘time environmental data to ensure precise and interoperable mission execution.

### Conditions:
- **Trigger:** Receipt of mission briefing and confirmation of sUAS availability.
- **Environment:**
  - Operational planning with digital flight data and environmental sensors.
  - Access to sUAS technical specifications and partner force interoperability requirements.
  - Contemporary operational factors (e.g., lessons learned from recent conflicts such as Ukraine).
- **End State:** A validated, data-driven flight plan with calculated release parameters approved for multinational sUAS operations.

### Standards:
- All calculations must be within a 5% error margin relative to established benchmarks.
- Parameters must accurately account for real-time environmental conditions and sUAS performance.
- Documentation and analysis must support interoperability with Partners and receive approval from the chain of command.
