## Course Description
- **Description**: This one-day workshop updates traditional PSYOP aerial dissemination by incorporating sUAS delivery platforms as aerial dissemination methods. The workshop covers essential calculations, formulas, and planning methods required for operations in the information environment (OIE) planners to effectively employ sUAS platforms for leaflet dissemination. Participants will progress through stages—from memorizing key bilingual terms, in thier target language,to platform selection, applying calculation methods, and finally integrating these into a comprehensive flight plan with MISO product development considerations.
- **Target Audience**: PSYOP planners and operators involved in aerial dissemination operations, particularly those transitioning to or incorporating sUAS platforms in their operations.
