## Course Description
- **Description**: This one-day workshop updates traditional PSYOP aerial dissemination by incorporating sUAS delivery platforms as aerial dissemination methods. The workshop covers essential calculations, formulas, and planning methods required for operations in the information environment (OIE) planners to effectively employ sUAS platforms for leaflet dissemination. Participants will progress through stagesâ€”from memorizing key bilingual terms, in thier target language,to platform selection, applying calculation methods, and finally integrating these into a comprehensive flight plan with MISO product development considerations.
- **Target Audience**: PSYOP planners and operators involved in aerial dissemination operations, particularly those transitioning to or incorporating sUAS platforms in their operations.

## Course Objectives
1. **Foundational Knowledge**
   - Memorize and apply key terms for SUAS aerial dissemination in English and Spanish
   - Identify and explain doctrinal constants (descent rates, spread factors, standard speeds)
   - Understand the relationship between key constants and operational significance

2. **Platform Selection & Analysis**
   - Evaluate sUAS platform capabilities and limitations
   - Analyze operational constraints and security considerations
   - Select appropriate platforms based on mission requirements

3. **Calculation Competencies**
   - Apply basic calculation methods for descent time and drift parameters
   - Calculate compound drift metrics and dispersion patterns
   - Determine leaflet density metrics for operational effectiveness

4. **Operational Planning**
   - Develop comprehensive flight plans incorporating technical parameters
   - Determine optimal release points based on calculated drift
   - Create mission profiles that account for all operational variables

5. **MISO Integration**
   - Evaluate MISO products for SUAS delivery suitability
   - Adapt product design to account for technical constraints
   - Optimize psychological impact while maintaining technical feasibility

6. **Practical Application**
   - Apply calculation methods to complex operational scenarios
   - Develop complete dissemination plans for realistic missions
   - Demonstrate proficiency in all aspects of SUAS leaflet dissemination
