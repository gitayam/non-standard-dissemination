## Workshop Description
UAS Calculations for Modern Aerial Dissemination: This 1-day workshop updates traditional PSYOP aerial dissemination by incorporating SUAS methods. Participants will progress through stagesâ€”from memorizing key bilingual terms to applying calculation methods and finally integrating these into a comprehensive flight plan with MISO product development considerations.

## Learning Objectives
1. Memorize Key Terms: Learn and recall essential terms for SUAS aerial dissemination in English and Spanish.
2. Understand Calculation Fundamentals: Grasp doctrinal constants (e.g., descent rates, spread factors) and basic drift estimates.
3. Apply Calculation Methods: Use provided charts and formulas to compute release points and drift patterns.
4. Develop a Flight Plan: Create a flight plan that integrates SUAS dissemination techniques using calculated data.
5. Integrate MISO Considerations: Adapt MISO product development to incorporate unique aspects of SUAS aerial dissemination (focus on PAAW).

## Note on Schedule Flexibility
The final portions of the day include time reserved for content review, make-up work, and completion of unfinished exercises. If all content is covered satisfactorily and there are no alibies (make-up work needed), students may be released early.
