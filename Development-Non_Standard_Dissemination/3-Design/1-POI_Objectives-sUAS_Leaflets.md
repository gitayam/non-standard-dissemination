## Workshop Description
UAS Calculations for Modern Aerial Dissemination: This 1-day workshop updates traditional PSYOP aerial dissemination by incorporating SUAS methods. Participants will progress through stagesâ€”from memorizing key bilingual terms to platform selection, applying calculation methods, and finally integrating these into a comprehensive flight plan with MISO product development considerations. The workshop emphasizes practical application and real-world scenario-based learning.

## Learning Objectives
1. **Foundational Knowledge**
   - Memorize and apply key terms for SUAS aerial dissemination in English and Spanish
   - Identify and explain doctrinal constants (descent rates, spread factors, standard speeds)
   - Understand the relationship between key constants and operational significance

2. **Platform Selection & Analysis**
   - Evaluate sUAS platform capabilities and limitations
   - Analyze operational constraints and security considerations
   - Select appropriate platforms based on mission requirements

3. **Calculation Competencies**
   - Apply basic calculation methods for descent time and drift parameters
   - Calculate compound drift metrics and dispersion patterns
   - Determine leaflet density metrics for operational effectiveness

4. **Operational Planning**
   - Develop comprehensive flight plans incorporating technical parameters
   - Determine optimal release points based on calculated drift
   - Create mission profiles that account for all operational variables

5. **MISO Integration**
   - Evaluate MISO products for SUAS delivery suitability
   - Adapt product design to account for technical constraints
   - Optimize psychological impact while maintaining technical feasibility

6. **Practical Application**
   - Apply calculation methods to complex operational scenarios
   - Develop complete dissemination plans for realistic missions
   - Demonstrate proficiency in all aspects of SUAS leaflet dissemination

## Note on Schedule Flexibility
The final portion of the day includes time reserved for practical application exercises and content review. This time allows for:
- Completion of complex calculation scenarios
- Development of comprehensive mission plans
- Review of key concepts and calculations
- Individual or team-based problem-solving exercises
