# Initial Risk Assessment
*(ATP 5-19, 14 April 2014, paras 1-13 thru 1-46)*

Using the information gathered from the task analysis, the initial risk assessment identifies potential hazards and risks associated with the training tasks. This assessment helps in developing controls to mitigate or eliminate these risks.

## Risk Assessment Framework

**Severity Categories:**
- Catastrophic: Death or permanent disability, system loss, major property damage
- Critical: Permanent partial disability, temporary disability, significant damage
- Marginal: Minor injury, minor occupational illness, minor system damage
- Negligible: First aid or minor medical treatment, minimal threat

**Probability Categories:**
- Frequent: Individual - Occurs very often, continuously experienced
- Likely: Individual - Occurs several times
- Occasional: Individual - Occurs sporadically
- Seldom: Individual - Remotely possible, could occur at some time
- Unlikely: Individual - Can assume will not occur, but not impossible

**Risk Categories:**
- High: Loss of ability to accomplish mission
- Medium: Degraded mission capability, reduced readiness
- Low: Little or no impact on accomplishment of mission

## Primary Risk Assessment

### TLO: Calculate and apply UAS leaflet dissemination parameters to develop effective MISO delivery plans

**Primary Control Measure**: Identify fire escapes and emergency procedures at start of class; ensure unobstructed access to exits

| Safety Factors / Hazards | Severity | Hazard Probability | Residual Risk |
|--------------------------|----------|--------------------| --------------|
| Fire (classroom setting) | Critical | Unlikely           | Low           |

## Specific Risks by Learning Objectives

### ELO A: Identify key doctrinal constants for UAS leaflet dissemination
#### LSA 1: Define key terms related to UAS aerial dissemination

**Control Measure**: Identify fire escapes at beginning of training

| Safety Factors / Hazards | Severity | Hazard Probability | Residual Risk |
|--------------------------|----------|--------------------| --------------|
| Fire (classroom setting) | Critical | Unlikely           | Low           |

### Additional Learning Objectives

All other ELOs and Learning Step Activities have been assessed with no additional significant risks identified beyond the primary fire risk in the classroom setting. These include:

- ELO B: Calculate required metrics for leaflet descent and drift parameters
- ELO C: Calculate compound drift metrics for leaflet dispersion patterns
- ELO D: Calculate leaflet density metrics for operational effectiveness
- ELO E: Develop an integrated flight plan for SUAS leaflet dissemination operations
- ELO F: Adapt MISO product design for SUAS aerial dissemination
- ELO G: Execute practical application exercises to reinforce UAS calculation skills

## Overall Risk Assessment Summary

This training is primarily classroom-based, focusing on doctrinal updates for UAS calculations. The overall risk is LOW due to the controlled indoor environment. 

The primary identified hazard is:

1. Fire risk in a classroom setting (Critical severity, Unlikely probability)

This risk will be mitigated by identifying fire escape routes and emergency procedures at the beginning of the class and ensuring all exits remain unobstructed. 

With these controls in place, the residual risk is reduced to LOW.
